#  Comprehensive EDA and Inferential Analysis on Global Cancer Patients (2015–2024)

This repository presents an **in-depth analysis of 50,000 multi-country cancer patient records (2015–2024)**.  
The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about **risk factors, treatment costs, cancer outcomes, and disparities** using exploratory data analysis (EDA), inferential statistics, and predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Project Context  

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, but outcomes and costs vary widely depending on **demographics, lifestyle, genetic risks, and healthcare access**.  
This project aims to provide **data-driven answers** to critical questions:  

- How do lifestyle risks like smoking and obesity interact with genetic predisposition?  
- Are higher treatment costs always linked with longer survival?  
- What patterns emerge across countries, cancer stages, and age groups?  
- Which factors best predict cancer severity and survival years?

## 🎯 Project Objectives  

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Identify disparities in diagnosis, lifestyle, treatment, and survival  
- Visualize correlations between risks, severity, and outcomes  
- Compare patterns across stages, genders, and countries  

### 2️⃣ Inferential & Predictive Analysis  
- Quantify relationships between **risk factors and severity**  
- Assess whether **treatment cost aligns with survival outcomes**  
- Build regression & ML models to **predict survival years**  
- Study how **genetic predisposition amplifies lifestyle risks**  

### 3️⃣ Insight Extraction  
- Translate findings into **clear, actionable insights**  
- Document results for **academic, clinical, and policy use**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Stat/ML Tools:** Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Lifelines (survival analysis)  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

--- 

## 📈 Key Insights  

- Patients diagnosed at **Stage IV** spend nearly **3× higher on treatment** but survive **~40% fewer years** than early-stage patients.  
- The **interaction between smoking and genetic risk** increases severity by ~30% and reduces survival by ~2 years.  
- Treatment cost showed **diminishing returns**—higher spend was not always linked to better survival outcomes.
